# PatrolNet — Mobile App

The Expo/React Native mobile application for PatrolNet. Available to **Tanod officers** and **Residents**.

---

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Notes |
|------|-------|
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) ≥ 18 | Required |
| [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) | Install on your Android/iOS device for quick testing |
| [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) | Required only if using an Android emulator instead of a physical device |
| [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) | Install globally: `npm install -g expo-cli` |

> The mobile app and the server **must be on the same Wi-Fi network** so the device can reach the API.

---

## Installation

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
```

---

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `mobile/` directory:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://<your-local-ip>:3001
```

Replace `<your-local-ip>` with the **local IP address** of the machine running the server (e.g. `192.168.1.32`). Do **not** use `localhost` — it won't work on a physical device or emulator.

**Finding your local IP:**
- **Linux/macOS:** `ip addr` or `ifconfig`
- **Windows:** `ipconfig`

---

## Running the App

### With Expo Go (Recommended for Development)

```bash
npx expo start
```

A QR code will appear in the terminal. Scan it with the **Expo Go** app on your phone.

### Android Emulator

Make sure Android Studio is open with an emulator running, then press `a` in the Expo terminal, or:

```bash
npm run android
```

### iOS Simulator (macOS only)

Press `i` in the Expo terminal, or:

```bash
npm run ios
```

## Testing the SOS Feature

The **SOS button** is visible on the **Login screen** — no login required.

1. Open the app to the Login screen.
2. **Log in at least once first** to store your user data locally (the SOS uses your saved `userId` and `username`).
3. Log out or navigate back to Login.
4. Tap the red **SOS** circle button.
5. Grant location permission when prompted.
6. The app will fetch your GPS coordinates, reverse-geocode the address, and send a `POST /sos-report` request to the server.
7. A success alert confirms the report was saved. You can verify the incident in the web admin dashboard.

**To test the backend directly without the app:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://<server-ip>:3001/sos-report \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId": "1",
    "username": "test_user",
    "latitude": 14.5995,
    "longitude": 120.9842,
    "location": "Test Location, Manila"
  }'
```
